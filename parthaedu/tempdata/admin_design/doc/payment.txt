In terms of which payment structure we are going to be using, after running through a 
whole lot of different options, the favourite model is the ShutterStock model. i
e. once you
 chose your photo, you select download, then you go to a payment page where you choose how many 
photos you want and get a discount for more bulk purchases.
They don't like the idea of 'credits' (as opposed to prices) as it's an extra thing for the 
user to get their head around, so that's good news as it's one less thing for us to have to think about.

They would like to give the option to buy one photo, but then incentivise a discounted bulk 
purchase to increase sales and loyalty (ie. like Shutterstock, if you buy 5 downloads, some 
can stay on your account for next time you come back).
We discussed a few more things concerning the site as well, but more content related issues.
 I will knock up a word doc to bring you up to date on everything.
